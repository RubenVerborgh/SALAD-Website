## Target audience
We welcome *people from different fields*,
even though the core audience of our workshop consists of
people with *interdisciplinary experience* in both Linked Data and Web APIs.
However, we encourage people with *various backgrounds* to participate,
since we envision that *interesting cross-domain discussions* will arise
when participants actively discover differences and similarities.

## Program
Our main goal is to make the workshop an interactive event,
where participants with different backgrounds interact in a positive and constructive way.

### Keynote
[Autonomous Agents on the Web: Beyond Linking and Meaning](/aperitif/)
<br>
by Mike Amundsen, Principal API Architect for Layer 7 Technologies

### Morning
Accepted authors present their paper,
specifically aiming at provoking thought and starting discussions.
The goal is to use the papers as a basis for initiating a discussion
and starting collaborative work.

### Afternoon
Presentation of remaining papers,
with a designated slot for a discussion of the introduced ideas and approaches,
which will be published online for future inspiration.
