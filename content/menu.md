## Program
To be determined.

## Target audience
We welcome *people from different fields*,
even though the core audience of our workshop consists of
people with *interdisciplinary experience* in both Linked Data and Web APIs.
However, we encourage people with *various backgrounds* to participate,
since we envision that *interesting cross-domain discussions* will arise
when participants actively discover differences and similarities.
