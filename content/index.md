## The challenge

The World Wide Web has undergone significant changes,
developing from a collection of a few interlinked static pages
to a global ubiquitous platform
for sharing, searching and browsing dynamic and customisable content,
in a variety of different media formats.
This transformation was triggered by the ever growing number of users and websites
and continues to be supported by current developments
such as the increased use and popularity of Linked Data and Web APIs.
Unfortunately, despite some initial efforts and progress towards integrated use,
these two technologies remain mostly disjunct in terms of developing solutions and applications.
To this purpose, SALAD aims to explore the possibilities of facilitating
a better fusion of Web APIs and Linked Data,
thus enabling the harvesting and provisioning of data through applications and services on the Web.
In particular, we focus on investigating how both static and dynamic resources
(for example, sensor data or streams), exposed via interfaces on the Web,
can be used together with semantic data,
as a means for enabling a shared use and providing a basis for developing rich applications.

## The workshop
With this workshop, we aim to discover new ways
to embrace the opportunities that Web APIs offer
in terms of *data consumption*, *processing* and *provisioning*
but also to investigate the possibilities
of integrating them more closely with Linked Data.
We want to challenge researchers towards
developing *integrated description and implementation approaches*
through both paper submissions and interactive on-site discussion and dialog.
In particular, we are looking for description approaches, implementation solutions,
use cases and applications that support a *more automated and unified* Web API use.

------

## The goals
The main goal of this workshop is to explore the possibilities
of enabling a more integrated and automated use of Web APIs,
given the context of the *growing importance of Linked Data and applications*,
benefiting from the available resources.
Relevant topics include:

- **frameworks**, **methods**, **models** and **formats** for describing Web APIs
- design of **distributed systems** based on semantic API technology
- overcoming **performance issues** in the interaction with APIs
- development of intelligent and generic **Web API clients**
- designing applications by connecting **Web APIs and Linked Data** for reading and writing
- addressing **scalability** issues while dealing with large data volumes
- **business models** for Linked Data and Web APIs
- developing technologies for a **sustainable**, **future-proof** integrated Web API environment

The above list is not exhaustive and we therefore actively encourage participants to be *creative*.
<br>
A final goal is to provide future initiatives with the devised ideas
and visions to *stimulate innovation* in this research area.
