header: Services and Applications over Linked APIs and Data

Welcome to the homepage of the SALAD2013 ESWC workshop.

## The challenge

Current developments on the Web have been marked
by the increased popularity of *Linked Data* and *Web APIs*.
However, these two technologies remain mostly disjunct
in terms of developing solutions and applications in an integrated way.
Therefore, we aim to explore the possibilities
of facilitating a *better integration* of Web APIs and Linked Data,
thus enabling the *harvesting and provisioning of data*
through applications and services on the Web.
In particular, we focus on investigating how resources exposed via Web APIs
can be used *together with Semantic Web data*,
as means for enabling a shared use and providing
a basis for *developing rich applications* on top.

## The workshop
With this workshop, we aim to discover new ways
to embrace the opportunities that Web APIs offer
in terms of *data consumption*, *processing* and *provisioning*
but also to investigate the possibilities
of integrating them more closely with Linked Data.
We want to challenge researchers towards
developing *integrated description and implementation approaches*
through both paper submissions and interactive on-site discussion and dialog.
In particular, we are looking for description approaches, implementation solutions,
use cases and applications that support a *more automated and unified* Web API use.

------

## The goals
The main goal of this workshop is to explore the possibilities
of enabling a more integrated and automated use of Web APIs,
given the context of the *growing importance of Linked Data and applications*,
benefiting from the available resources.
Relevant topics include:

- **frameworks**, **methods**, **models** and **formats** for describing Web APIs
- identifying the **essential building blocks** for enabling integrated and linked use of Web APIs
- pinpointing **challenges** to move from individual Web APIs towards **integrated solutions**
- capturing **added value** through the use of Web APIs, Linked Data and development of **client
apps**
- developing technologies for a **sustainable**, **future-proof** integrated Web API environment.

The above list is not exhaustive and we therefore actively encourage participants to be *creative*.
<br>
A final goal is to provide future initiatives with the devised ideas
and visions to *stimulate innovation* in this research area.
