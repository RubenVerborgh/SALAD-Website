Where?
: Portoro≈æ, Slovenia at the [ESWC conference](http://2015.eswc-conferences.org/)

### Recipe
Current developments on the Web have been marked by the increased use and popularity of Linked Data and Web APIs. However, these two technologies remain mostly disjunct in terms of developing solutions and applications in an integrated way. Therefore, we aim to explore the possibilities of facilitating a better integration of Web APIs and Linked Data, thus enabling the harvesting and provisioning of data through applications and services on the Web. In particular, we focus on investigating how resources exposed via Web APIs can be used together with Web semantic data, as means for enabling a shared use and providing a basis for developing rich applications on top.

### Shopping list
The main goal of this workshop is to explore the possibilities of enabling a more integrated and automated use of Web APIs, given the context of the growing importance of Linked Data and applications, benefiting from the available resources. Relevant topics include:

- frameworks, methods, models and formats for describing Web APIs
- design of distributed systems based on semantic API technology
- overcoming performance issues in the interaction with APIs
- development of intelligent and generic Web API clients
- designing applications by connecting Web APIs and Linked Data for reading and writing
- address scalability issues while dealing with large data volumes
- business models for Linked Data and Web APIs
- developing technologies for a sustainable, future-proof integrated Web API environment

The above list is not exhaustive and we therefore actively encourage participants to be creative.
A final goal is to provide future initiatives with the devised ideas and visions to stimulate innovation in this research area.
